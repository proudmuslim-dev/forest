A custom frontend for the [TradeOgre](http://tradeogre.com) exchange, written using [Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced).

## Why TradeOgre?

It's a simple, non-KYC exchange that I found out about recently. I found its simplicity refreshing and enjoyed using it immensely, so I decided I'd write a frontend for it.
